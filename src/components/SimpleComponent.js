// In the components/SimpleComponent.js file, create a SimpleComponent component.

// The component should be declared as a class (instance of Component) so that it can carry state.

// The component should have a state property called mood that has a default value of happy.

// The component should simply render its current mood state to the page in a div.

// The component should implement a handleClick function that can serve as a callback to the <div>'s click event. When clicked, the component's mood should toggle between happy and sad states.

import React, { Component } from 'react';

export default class SimpleComponent extends Component {

    state = {
        mood: 'happy'
    }

    handleClick = () => {
        this.setState({
            mood: 'sad'
        })
    }

    render(){
        return(
            <div onClick={this.handleClick}>
                {this.state.mood}
